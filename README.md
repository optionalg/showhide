Simple script to toggle hidden files in the Finder in Mac OSX.  

I wrote it because Command+Shift+Period appears to no longer work in Mavericks.

For best results:

1.  Copy file "showhide" into bin folder in your $PATH, e.g., /usr/local/bin/
2.  Make file executable:  chmod +x showhide

From the command line, type: showhide

Alternatively, it can be run from any folder it exists in by typing: ./showhide

Showhide will show files if they are hidden and hide them if they are showing.

Enjoy!
