Simple script to toggle hidden files in the Finder in Mac OSX

For best results:

1.  Copy into bin folder in your $PATH, e.g., /usr/local/bin/
2.  Make file executable:  chmod +x hider.sh
2.  rename from hider.sh to hider

From the command line, type: hider

Alternatively, can be run as-is from any folder by typing: ./hider.sh

Hider will show files if they are hidden and hide them if they are showing.

Enjoy!
