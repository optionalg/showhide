Simple script to toggle hidden files in the Finder in Mac OSX.  

I wrote it because Command+Shift+Period appears to no longer work in Mavericks.

For best results:

1.  Copy into bin folder in your $PATH, e.g., /usr/local/bin/
2.  Make file executable:  chmod +x hider

From the command line, type: hider

Alternatively, can be run as-is from any folder by typing: ./hider

Hider will show files if they are hidden and hide them if they are showing.

Enjoy!
